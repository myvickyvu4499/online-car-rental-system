#Online Car Rental System

A new car rental business needs an online booking system. As an initial prototype they are requesting a system that would provide a quote based on car type and number of rental days
# Bank Institution Term Deposit Predictive Model
The investment and portfolio department of the Bank of Portugal would want to be able to identify their customers who potentially would subscribe to their term deposits. As there has been heightened interest of marketing managers to carefully tune their directed campaigns to the rigorous selection of contacts, the goal of your employer is to find a model that can predict which future clients who would subscribe to their term deposit. 

### Objectives
* Data exploration
* Data cleaning
* Feature extraction
* Developing a robust machine learning algorithms.
